# Billboard Advertisement Recommendation System

The Billboard Advertisement Recommendation System is an intelligent and dynamic advertising platform that selects advertisements to be displayed on billboards based on real-time traffic and pedestrian demographics. The system employs computer vision, machine learning algorithms, and content-based filtering to analyze and understand the audience present at a given time and then display the most relevant advertisements.

## Features

- Utilizes computer vision algorithms with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect and count vehicles and pedestrians from traffic camera feeds in real-time.
- Employs face analysis to estimate the age and identify the gender of pedestrians by integrating VGGFace with ResNet50.
- Detect various groups of people such as families, groups of children, couples, single men and women and groups of people using computer vision.
- Uses clustering algorithms, specifically DBSCAN, to analyze spatial relationships among pedestrians and categorize them into groups such as families, groups of children, couples, single men, and single women.
- Groups are formed based on age, size, and spatial proximity.
- Classify vehicles into categories such as cars, trucks, and bikes.
- Recommend an advertisement based on the groups of people and types of vehicles detected.
- Content-based filtering is implemented using cosine similarity to calculate the relevance of advertisements based on the demographic composition and vehicle types.
- The system computes a weighted sum of advertisement preferences based on the cosine similarity of the current scene to historical advertisement performance data.
- Advertisements with the highest weighted preference are selected for display.
- The system can also employ collaborative filtering as an alternative method for advertisement recommendations.
- Traffic data is normalized to calculate the percentage representation of different demographic groups and vehicle types in the current scene.
- This allows for more accurate recommendations based on the relative significance of different audience segments.
- Works with images.
